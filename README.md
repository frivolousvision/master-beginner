# credit-card-checker

This is the first repository I created on GitHub.

The goal of this project was to create functions that test whether
a provided series of numbers is a valid credit card number.  

There were mutliple batches of arrays of numbers provided and using 
the Luhn algorithm and JavaScript I tested the numbers to see if 
they were correctly fomatted credit card numbers.
